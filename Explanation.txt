Given an array, a increment consists of choosing any A[i], and incrementing it by 1.
Return the least number of increment to make every value in array unique.

Input description:
Length of the array in integer L,
in next line, array elements of size L

Output description:
the least number of increment to make every value in array unique.

Sample Input:
7
3 4 5 2 4 1 2

Sample Output:
7

Explanation:
To make the array unique, we need to check for the duplicates,
after 7 increment the array will be (3,4,5,2,6,1,7),ie.,
the second 4 as 4+1+1=6 (2 increment) and second 2 as 2+1+1+1+1+1 (5 increment) 
therefore the total increment is 2+5=7
so the output is 7

Sample Input:
5
12 15 17 12 15

Samplpe Output:
2
